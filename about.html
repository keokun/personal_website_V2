        Hi, I'm Kristen. I am currently a senior in the Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program majoring in Computer Science and double minoring in Japanese and Visual Arts. I have a passion for both technology and the arts. I am currently interning at Global Aerospace as a Junior Application Developer.
        <br><br>
        For the last two years, I have attended HackHERS, a women-centric hackathon hosted annually at Rutgers University. In 2018, I independently developed a web application designed to be an efficient messenger and reporting system for use by educators during emergency situations. For this project, I won both the JPMorgan Chase Best Hack for Social Good Award and the HackHERS By Women for Women Award. In 2017, I collaborated with a team to create a mobile game that motivates children and teens to pursue an interest in STEM. Despite having no prior experience in mobile app development, we took the initiative to research and learn the required skills and succeeded in designing an app that won the Best Beginner Hack Award.
        <br><br>
        In fall 2017, I co-founded the Rutgers Creative Writing Club with another student after we recognized that many of our peers were interested in a more casual environment for workshopping and discussing their own writing as opposed to submitting to on-campus publications. I developed and continue to maintain the website for this club to provide updates on meeting information and writing resources. I acted as treasurer during the first year, and I am now the president for the 2018-2019 academic year.
